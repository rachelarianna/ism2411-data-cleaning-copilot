#Github Copilot was used to give me a base for my code. In other words, it helped point me in the right direction. When I figured out what to do, I ended up tweaking the code to best fit what I need to do. 

For example, in the load_data, clean_column_names, and handle_missing_values, I wrote short comments to describe what I wanted to do and then tweaked it to however the assignment wanted it formatted. The main things I changed in the code was the variable names and structure, as they weren't quite right.

 I was able to use copilot to understand how to get the best code possible, and how this fits in the real world. A big challenege I had was ensuring my script ran correctly, which was very time consuming. However, after using copilot, I found this issue was made easier.
